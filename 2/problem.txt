
Problem #3
Create a simple context menu that floats over a page. Don't use any samples or libraries.
- There is a button on the page and the menu pops up next to it when clicked
- The menu should have at least 2 levels (submenus)
- The content should be driven by a JSON object at the top of the script
- Some menu items should go to URLs; some should be assigned Javascript functions
- The menu should not go away until 2 seconds after you have rolled out of it or after you have selected an option
- Style is not as important as function.
